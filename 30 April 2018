I'm not sure what a new file does or how to use it.
I'm using this "new file" to serve as a place to list what my goals are for the day for Rprogramming.
Some of my goals are related to answering questions I have:
  1. What defines a project in R?
  2. Can I work on more than one project in R at the same time?
  3. If I work on more than one project in R at the same time, what is the most effective way to manage files and branching?
  4. If I install libraries from one File (.R file), do I still need to install them from another file?
  5. How regularly do I need to install (or re-install) R packages?

Some of my goals are related to running the R project for Exposure Response Analysis for China Energy Transitions:
  1. What are the pathways through which I can open, run, and edit the project files?
  2. Let's add the province categories--is this something I can do (with guidance)?
  3.
