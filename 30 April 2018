I'm not sure what a new file does or how to use it.
I'm using this "new file" to serve as a place to list what my goals are for the day for Rprogramming.
Some of my goals are related to answering questions I have:
  1. What defines a project in R?
  2. Can I work on more than one project in R at the same time?
  3. If I work on more than one project in R at the same time, what is the most effective way to manage files and branching?
  4.
